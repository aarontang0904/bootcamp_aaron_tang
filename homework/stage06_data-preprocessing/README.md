# Data Preprocessing (Stage 06)

## Functions

- Filled missing values in numeric columns with median values
- Dropped columns with too many missing values
- Normalized numeric features to a common scale

## Assumptions

- Median imputation is more robust to outliers than mean
- Columns with high missingness do not provide reliable information
- Normalization improves comparability between numeric features
