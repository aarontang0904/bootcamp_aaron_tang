# Stakeholder Memo — Dividend Index Strategy and Yield Spread Analysis

## Background

Dividend equity indices are an important allocation tool for income-focused investors, but their performance is highly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions, particularly interest rate levels and yield spreads. Rising bond yields can make dividend-paying equities less attractive, while falling yields often boost demand for them.

## Problem

Currently, portfolio managers lack a systematic way to measure and forecast how yield curve shifts or credit spread changes impact dividend index performance. Decisions are often based on ad-hoc judgment, which increases the risk of mistimed allocations.

## Project Scope

This project will analyze historical yield spreads (e.g., Treasury 10Y–2Y, credit spreads) and dividend index returns to identify conditions where dividend strategies outperform or underperform.

## Deliverables

<Bullets:>

- A clean dataset linking spreads to dividend index returns.
- Regression and scenario analysis quantifying spread–return sensitivities.
- A dashboard highlighting scenarios (e.g., inverted yield curve) and expected index performance.
- A summary memo with decision triggers for overweight/underweight positioning.

## Next Steps

<Bullets:>

- Stage 01: Define spread metrics and gather data.
- Stage 02: Run regressions and scenario analysis.
- Stage 03: Deliver interactive dashboard and final stakeholder memo.
